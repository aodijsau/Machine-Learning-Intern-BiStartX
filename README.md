## Introduction

During my internship at BiStartX, I had the opportunity to work on various machine learning tasks. This experience allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge to practical problems. The tasks cover a range of algorithms and techniques, demonstrating the versatility of machine learning in solving real-world issues.

## Tasks Overview

Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the six tasks included in this repository:

1. **Linear Regression**: This task involved predicting house prices based on various features. I implemented a linear regression model and evaluated its performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE).

2. **Decision Trees**: In this task, I built a decision tree classifier to categorize customer data. The model helped in understanding the decision-making process based on various attributes.

3. **Clustering**: I used clustering techniques to segment customers based on purchasing behavior. This task helped in identifying different customer profiles and tailoring marketing strategies.

4. **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: I implemented an SVM model to classify images. This task focused on understanding the margin of separation and the kernel trick.

5. **Neural Networks**: I built a simple neural network for image recognition. This task introduced me to deep learning concepts and the importance of data preprocessing.

6. **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: In this task, I worked on sentiment analysis using NLP techniques. I used libraries like NLTK and Scikit-learn to analyze text data.
